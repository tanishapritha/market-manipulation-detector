        "text": "There\u2019s a lot of confusion around FTDs, T+35 deadlines, and how market makers keep kicking the can. Here\u2019s a full breakdown of how it actually works and how it applies to GME right now.\n\n What is T+35?\n\nWhen a trade fails to deliver (FTD), market makers have 35 trading days to resolve it.\n\nThis is tracked by the NSCC, and T+35 is the final day they are supposed to deliver shares or close out the fail.\n\nExample: If millions of FTDs were created on June 12, then July 17 is the official T+35 deadline.\n\n\n\nWhat is REX Code 068?\n\nIt\u2019s an obscure regulatory exemption that allows clearing members to delay FTD resolution beyond T+35.\n\nBased on historical patterns, REX 068 appears to grant up to 13 extra trading days to delay.\n\nSo a June 12 FTD \u2192 July 17 (T+35) \u2192 Aug 14\u201319 (final extension window).\n\n\n\n Why hasn\u2019t GME exploded yet?\n\nBecause they don\u2019t cover FTDs all at once. They:\n\n1. Run the price slightly (e.g., $23 to $25)\n\n\n2. Short it back down to $23\u2013$24\n\n\n3. Use that volume to close a portion of FTDs\n\n\n4. Repeat the cycle, stretching the delivery window\n\n\n\nThis turns the FTD cycle into a negotiable game of supply and sentiment.\n\n\n---\n\n Synthetic FTD Coverage: The Hidden Delay Trick\n\nHere\u2019s what most people miss:\n\n>  They can sell large amounts of deep OTM calls to synthetically cover FTDs.\n\n\n\nThis satisfies some NSCC requirements without delivering real shares\n\nIt gives the appearance of delivery \u2014 or the ability to deliver\n\nOnce those calls expire, the new T+35 window starts from the expiration date\n\n\nThis tactic allows market makers to:\n\nDelay real share delivery\n\nControl short-term price action\n\nAvoid breaking regulatory rules\n\n\n\n Why This Matters Right Now\n\nGME had 1.5M+ FTDs around June 12\n\nT+35 = July 17, 2025\n\nREX 068 extension = ~Aug 14\u201319 window\n\nEarnings land shortly after that\n\n\n> If high retail volume aligns with this window, and shorts get pinned, forced covering can trigger large moves.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nT+35 = 35 trading days from original fail\n\nREX 068 = up to 13-day extension\n\nOTM calls can be sold to synthetically \"cover\" FTDs\n\nT+35 resets from the day those synthetic calls expire\n\nJuly 17\u2013Aug 19 = High alert window\n\n\ud83d\udd25So if you look at the call chain and price is at $23.50 and there's 10-20k calls near $30 thats not retail thats the synthetic covering, and the new T+35 timer starts at exp of those calls.\n\nStay sharp. Watch volume, options chains, and pressure points. This game isn\u2019t over.\n",

        "text": "GameStop Corp. GME delivered a notable improvement in its fiscal first-quarter 2025 results, driven largely by disciplined cost management and improved operational efficiency. The company slashed adjusted SG&A expenses by 24.8% year over year, bringing the metric down to $225.3 million. As a percentage of net sales, adjusted SG&A improved 320 basis points to 30.8%. This underscores management\u2019s efforts to streamline operations and enhance efficiency without undermining core business functions.\n\nThe company\u2019s cost discipline supported a 3.4% rise in gross profit, which increased to $252.8 million from $244.5 million. Gross margin expanded significantly by 680 basis points to 34.5%, highlighting improved pricing and cost control. Despite declining revenues, GameStop managed to protect its product-level profitability.\n\nOperationally, GameStop saw strong gains. Adjusted EBITDA turned positive at $38.6 million, reversing a loss of $37.6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income also improved significantly, reaching $27.5 million in contrast to a loss of $55 million in the last year. \n\nGameStop\u2019s bottom-line performance further highlighted the benefits of its cost restructuring. The company shifted from a net loss of $32.3 million to a net income of $44.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Adjusted net income improved to $83.1 million from a loss of $36.7 million, with adjusted earnings per share rising to 17 cents from an adjusted loss of 12 cents in the prior-year quarter. \n\nHowever, net sales declined 17% year over year, due to weakness in hardware and software. Growth in the collectibles segment offered some offset, but long-term success will depend on stabilizing core revenues and scaling newer growth areas.\n\n",

Everything is covered. I don't have margin enabled. \n\n\n\n2. I'll be happy to buy the shares or sell the shares at those prices in this time frame.\n\n\n\n3. Its not free money and all investing has the risk of losses.\n\n  \nI've also made a spreadsheet to show the math.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1tx81jnivaf1.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=f062918c14f9a838c585a432569cfb79ec449949\n\n  \nI did reduce my potential annual income due to making less  But I increased my potential yield due to risking less. The most important part here to me is that I made more than week 1 even though I took almost half the risk.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEli5?\n\n\n\nTo try and explain what I\u2019m doing here lets make up an analogy of a coin flipping game. \n\n\n\nTo play the game you must buy in with $20. Every time you get heads you win. The first win is $10, and every time after that you double your money. You get to flip the coin a maximum of 7 times. The player can choose to stop to collect the winnings. If you get one tails you lose.\n\n\n\nSo total winnings can be $620, for a small price of $20. But the chance to get 7 heads in a row is less than 1%. Even just to break even with 2 heads in a row is 25%. \n\n\n\n3 heads for $20 winnings: 12.5% chance.\n\n\n\n4 heads for a $60 win: 6.25% chance.\n\n\n\n5 heads for $140 win: 3.125% chance.\n\n\n\n6 heads for $300 win: 1.5625% chance.\n\n\n\nI like to be the seller of this game which is why I like to sell weekly lottos. Although I don\u2019t make much, I have a high chance to make the money each time.\n\n\n\n(Note: First time I played this game with my gf she got 5 heads in a row and I had to pay her $140.)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n  \nHappy 4th of July. See you next week.",

I my self am not much of an IPhone gamer but thought since it's so accessible and comes so highly recommended that I might give it a shot. Before I do, I just had one really basic question I wanted to ask. I was just curious and wanted to know how much of the gme would be locked behind a paywall? I know that the Applevis site says it's free with in app purchase. Money is really tight for me right now so I just wanted to know how much of the game will I be able to play before I run up against locked content, or will I be able to watch ads to get around that somehow?\nThanks in advance for any information you can give. I'm really interested in exploring this title assuming not too much of it will be restricted to those of us who are just barely getting by.",

During the broader market downturn around April 7th\u20138th, its price was still holding around $22\u201323, which shows some relative strength.\nGiven the current setup, I think there's a good chance the stock may maintain its upward momentum over the next few months.\nJust my two cents \u2014 curious to hear what others think.",

Its been 1 bear flag after another and it keeps chopping sideways. My best guess is shorts let the stock run Monday maybe get close to $25 then on Tuesday Trump makes a decision on tariffs is he reinstate the tariffs I expects shorts to do what they do best SHORT to cover the FTDs due July 17th. If tariffs get reinstated the expepect a short from near $25 to sub $23.",

        "text": "I used to scrape GameStop's PSA web store multiple times a day to see trends in inventories. This worked well for many months until they changed something that blocked my bot... I never fixed it so haven't looked at trends recently.\n\nWhat I did see was a downward trend in stock from people buying with small spikes when they would add new stock to the website. I watch the total graded cards go from \\~5000 slowly down to \\~3000 over a few months.\n\nIt's currently sitting at 7946 total cards. Since I haven't been watching trends I can't tell you if this has been one huge inventory addition, or if they have been incrementally but this is by far the highest I have seen. The price estimates might not seem large in comparison to the rest of GameStop's operations, but keep in mind this is roughly $800k in pieces of cardboard, this is a huge inventory for this kind of collectable. They are constantly buying new cards and selling them for a profit, they are taking a cut on all PSA submissions, and also getting the additional sales when people come in to use this service. This is a collectibles fly-wheel which will keep gaining momentum.\n\nBrick by brick, PSA slab by PSA slab.",

Be safe, keep holding, and hopefully next week we see some late GME fireworks.\n\n[https://youtu.be/VkuQL4wjLLQ?si=W39Uhr1h-sOMkl7s&t=520](https://youtu.be/VkuQL4wjLLQ?si=W39Uhr1h-sOMkl7s&t=520)",

Moass tomorrow, but tomorrow comes and nothing. It will continue to do nothing cause the bigwigs who short this stock are the ones in control and nothing can be done about it. So if you want your money just to sit for years and you make nothing then leave it in GME. For me it\u2019s not worth it anymore. Just like DFV said 5 years and nothing then it\u2019s time to move on. Idc if GME has no debt or it\u2019s bought bitcoin the stock price is what I care about and it\u2019s taking way to long and nothing to show. It\u2019s the slowest moving stock. You make better returns on CCL or sound or Tesla.  Wake up people and quit listening to these gamers who are delusional. ",

        "title": "And all I got from the SEC is ...\"we acknowledge your email...\"",
        "text": "I finally had time last weekend to write back to the SEC (see previous [SEC says I am not allowed to know who caused the CAT errors... : r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1kcjda2/sec_says_i_am_not_allowed_to_know_who_caused_the/))  Note: I am not a MULN investor; only GME, and DRS'd at that.  MULN has appeared on the Nasdaq RegSHO list every day since last summer when I started noticing it.  **TL;DR:** The SEC is lazy as and does absolutely nothing.\n\n\"Hello again SEC,\n\nThe latest CAT error statistics were released on Thursday night, 26th June ( [https://www.catnmsplan.com/sites/default/files/2025-06/06.26.25-Monthly-CAT-Update-Final.pdf](https://www.catnmsplan.com/sites/default/files/2025-06/06.26.25-Monthly-CAT-Update-Final.pdf)  ). I note that on 17th June there were 7 BILLION CAT errors recorded. All the measures you outlined in your email are simply not working to prevent errors from happening in the first place.  Anonymity should not be granted to those who cause such errors; section 613 doesn\u2019t help investors with the necessary transparency.  In this modern day and age, it is unconscionable to have financial market systems where continuous errors are allowable and not managed.  Once again, I stress that the SEC is failing in its duties to stop CAT errors happening.  Even in the previous report from May 2025, 3.6B errors were reported on 14th April; 1.1B errors on 15th April; 2.6B errors on 16th April; and 1.6B errors on 1st May. This is not acceptable.\n\nAnd yes, while the RegSHO reporting is a measure of \u201ccumulative number of all fails outstanding until that day, plus new fails that occur that day, less fails that settle that day,\u201d it does not explain why, stocks like MULN (Mullen Automotive) have appeared on it every single day for months and months. Why is this consistently allowed? Are the fails-to-deliver settled and then failed again on the same day by the same participants? MULN has been on the NASDAQ RegSho for months. The SEC has allowed this situation where fails-to-deliver occur day after day. Who keeps failing to deliver?  And why can\u2019t we as investors know who consistently fails to deliver this and other stocks?\n\nThe headline on the SEC website says \u201cWe make markets work better.\u201d That is incongruent with the evidence. Please revert with an action plan on:\n\n\\* How the SEC will prevent CAT errors from occurring  \n\\* How the SEC will make the names of those responsible for CAT errors visible to investors  \n\\* How the SEC will investigate and stop continuous fails-to-deliver so that investors receive what they have purchased on the date expected\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nRegards,  \nTransatlanticMadame.\"\n\nand they responded today - with the laziest response ever that someone could say \"well I responded before a holiday weekend.\"\n\n\"Dear TransatlanticMadame:\n\nThank you for providing additional information to the Ombuds of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding published statistics about reports to the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT).
