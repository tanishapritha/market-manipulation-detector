        "text": "Hello! I'm looking for one or two more players to add to a campaign I'm running with some friends. We play DM-less, using Mythic GME and RPG. \n\nThis campaign is pretty dark, but we all work to handle serious topics respectfully. I can actually go into detail in DMs, but this is not the campaign for you if you aren't okay with confronting serious issues with nuance. \n\nThis is *also* not the campaign for you if you're looking for edgy topics without any significant meaning behind them. \n\nI'll start with the system, Mythic. We play through Discord, so have now simplified stat checks to asking odds questions. It's a very basic system, you'll really just need to learn how to interpret the Fate Chart (which is easier than it seems).\n\nWe're *very* narrative focused, so don't expect a lot of combat in this. All combat is also resolved through yes/no questions, using the Fate Chart. \n\nWe don't have a set time that we meet each week. I do my best to find out when everyone is available and schedule sessions accordingly. No voice chat is involved. \n\nBecause this is DM-less, everyone is expected to contribute to the story, worldbuilding, and playing NPCs. In particular, we could use more players who are comfortable playing villains and other important NPCs (though you will also have your own PC).\n\nWe have a very diverse cast of characters, inspired by various cultures and time periods. The base setting is medieval fantasy, but *nothing* is off limits so long as the culture would make sense to exist around that [very broad] time period. \n\nI'm looking for people who have decent writing skills, so I will require a very brief (about a paragraph or two) writing sample. \n\nI will provide the character and a brief background for them. All you have to do is give me an inner monologue (or something else, if you want) from their perspective. \n\nThe character has a pretty intense background, lots to work with, so it shouldn't be too difficult. \n\nTo verify that you've actually read this, please type \"fish\" somewhere in your comment. \n\nIf you have questions, feel free to throw them at me. I am happy to answer!\n\nEdit: We are in the US, forgot to include that in the title!\n",

        "text": "I was doing a bit of thinking about my own investment strategy, seeing lots and lots of red and got me to realize something.   \nHere is where we stand: \n\n**On the bullish side:** \n\n*  IF you treat the new bonds as straight cash for now and not the debt they really are (which is reasonable imo given the 7-year timeline), $8.63 billion / 447.3 million shares = $19.30 per share. **Thats the floor.** \n   * The low since the bond offering was 21.72 and the high was 24.43, with the vast majority of trading occuring between 22 and 24. we are clearly in a stable zone. \n   * Even if you take away the bonds, the floor is still \\~$14.\n* IV is at record lows, literally in the 0-4% range right now \n   * The new delta-neutral bond traders AND options sellers both profit off of higher IV. They are not making much money now. Also, default in this situation is short vega. The only winner is Market Makers who can maintain delta neutral low gamma books without hedging too much on new positions\n   * Correct me if im wrong but this is THE time to DCA into leaps over the next few weeks? \n*  All major momentum oscillators are trending oversold or neutral; RSI is between 30-40, MACD is negative but bottoming (the worst is nearly over)\n   * Richard Newton seems to think there MAY be one more dip; idk either way but if he does that may be genuine YOLO time\n\n**On the bearish side:** \n\n* Volume continues to fall\n* MA's continue to trend down \n* There is no bullish crossover yet on RIS or MACD\n* Low IV may actually mean nothing will happen soon\n* Options volume is shockingly low for the IV\n* Macro market is near ATH and may drag GME down with it if it corrects \n\n\\^ Bearish side is all true, but it wont be forever. This seems to be a... wild setup? \n\n  \nIn April 2024, GME had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $1.083 billion divided by a total sharecount of 310 million, equalling a cash floor of $3.50 per share while the price was around $10 (2.85x). I am not sure what the IV was back then, but it couldnt have been high as the price had fallen from $15 over the last month. That 4-year low in both  is what prompted Keith to make his move and build a gamma ramp on top of basket swap/ftd/? action. \n\nBased on this information, I cannot see how this current enviornment isnt building a PERFECT setup (extremely low IV and price). Price can only drop by $2-3 more in the next 7 years, and IV has NEVER been below 45% since 2020.   \nIF WE HIT A SIMULTANIOUS low in both, and that happens to coincide right before Swap dates or FTD regions... it may be go time. If not then, then probably fucking never jfc \n\nIn heindsight, yeah no shit it was obv never dates. Perhaps the Semour meme wasnt about waiting for RC, it was about waiting for price action to get LOW before an inevitable runup. Compression can only go so far.\n\nA few times over the last year (early Jan, late May) where price goes up, IF gamma ramps had been concentrated, it could have plausibly mooned as many TA guys were calling for- but they didnt. Price and IV were not low enough beforehand to create a setup.   \nThis time may be different. \n\n  \nNo dates, look for red. \n\n\n\n",

Instead of endless research or relying on hyped up 'influencers,' what if you could receive a daily delivery of a potentially high-impact crypto token, selected based on criteria no one else is talking about?\n   This isn't your typical airdrop. It's not about random tokens or pump-and-dumps. It's a structured, almost 'curated' daily stream of tokens that aims to identify the diamonds in the rough before they hit mainstream radar. Think of it as your daily dose of potential alpha, without the stress of constant market watching.\n   Could a system like this truly empower retail investors in the crypto space, giving us a unique edge? Or is it just another pipe dream? I'm curious to hear your thoughts on whether a 'daily token discovery' mechanism could disrupt the traditional crypto investment landscape.",

Given the current risk/reward picture, I am *not* bullish $GME above $25 ⚠️ \n\nNot saying we won't see higher prices, as volatility is the tail that wags the dog (influences price a ton) so the volatility/options market can support GME higher (play the risks in front of you) but macroeconomics alone is bad for GameStop....\n\nRising Treasury yields weakens future cash flows, discount rate and thus equity valuations. The bottom line is compression on earnings that favors insurance like businesses (Warren Buffet recently stepped down, as if to setup his successor to \"buy the dip\" on the insurance market). Microsoft laid off how much of its workforce recently? \n\nFrom my perspective, GameStop is growing increasingly dependent on playing volatility, abstractly. From social to financial.. and the similarities between 1690's projectors behaviors and RC's.. has me concerned. It contradicts a lot of the original messaging from RC himself (with that interview with Joe iirc back in 2021), suggesting a internal cultural pivot, maybe around early last year summer, towards more social vol playing over fundamental investing in the business.\n\nLet me put it this way, I love GameStop in part because I grew up with the company, even worked at my local GameStop during college, but from a pure macroeconimic lens, the risk/reward on GME above $25 isn't for me. Not at all. I've called out below $20 with interest, last year and most recently $21.50, but if it wasn't for the volatility risks in play, I wouldn't have even considered $21.50! I buy under valued assets that align with current risks then manage them. It's boring but it works.\n\nSo please be careful going forward. This whole saga can be a lot of fun but like Jurassic Park:\n\n> \"Oh, yeah. Oooh, ahhh, that’s how it always starts. Then later there’s running and screaming [for the exit]\"\n\nManage risk or risk will manage you.\n\n\n-Budget",

Hire people, not CVs.\n\n2. Consistency is the preeminent superpower - it’s what unlocks everything else.\n\n3. Ignore industry standards, think independently.\n\n4. If you look back a few years and feel like you had little idea of what you were doing, that’s a telltale sign of learning and growth.\n\n5. Stay focused on customers and execute.\n\n6. Don’t just hire excellent people. Create a culture where the people you hire are likely to excel.\n\n7. There’s a community behind every “individual success.”\n\n8. Until you have listened to, understood, and can defend opposing views to your own, hold your own views loosely.\n\n9. When you’re on a 20-year journey, what matters is that you’re with the right people, going to the right place, in the right way. \n\n10. Every company is just a company. However, on rare occasions, some companies become movements.\n\n#”\n\n#$GME FTW",

Sannsynlighet for at flere lojale GME / BBBY investorer kommer med blir større for hver dag. GNS får mer og mer oppmerksomhet på sosiale medier. Flere øyer, flere investorer, mange store ting som skjer om dagen med GNS.\n\nMye oppmerksomhet rundt Fidelity som har stengt muligheten til å kjøpe GNS på plattformen deres med mindre man ringer inn og sitter i kø en halvtime. GameStop vibes. Stort søksmål som er blitt jobbet med i 3 år av Wes Christian (Advokaten som fikk OverStock til å eksplodere). Rico søksmål på $750 millioner mot Moe & Ritz som potensielt har jobbet for store firmaer om å ødelegge GNS fra innsiden som nå risikerer å bli rammet og bli dratt ned i dragsuget de har vært med å bygge.\n\nEtt søksmål som estimeres å være oppimot 1 milliard dollar for naked short sales.\n\nEn daglig leder som faktisk sloss for aksjonærene sine, en som selv har mistet over $300 millioner dollar fra all denne manipulasjonen på markedet over 3 år. Dette er en daglig leder som kommuniserer med sine aksjonærer og er i offensiven nå for å sloss for rettferdighet og for å fjerne svulsten av korrupsjon mot deres selskap og aksjemarkedet.\n\nGjør din egen research, gå dypt inn i det. Bruk hodet, tenk og analyser selv. De som kommenterer at det er en pump og dump har ikke gjort noe innsats på å finne informasjon, og om de har gjort det, så vil jeg bare si til de det gjelder: Du er en idiot.\n\nEdit: Selskapet har også mulighet til å kjøpe 20% tilbake av aksjene. De kommer også til å kjøpe Bitcoin for 50% av det de får fra rettssakene, samt gi resterende 50% som utbytte. Opptil $7 pr aksje og 5000 bitcoins.\n\nDaglig leder eier 10% av selskapet og kjøpte 650 000 aksjer her om dagen.\n\n😂\n\nJeg er her for double og triple digits. Long term, short term. Potensielt også opp til $7 pr aksje i UTBYTTE dersom selskapet vinner pengene de har søkt om i søksmålene. Dette er en aksje som jeg har snakket og vært i lenge. Sjekk gjerne profilen min.\n\nLet’s gro. (De som gjør DD skjønner hva jeg mener)\n\nEdit: **✍🏼 Prisen var $1.44 når dette innlegget ble skrevet.**",

        "text": "People skip the basics. They'll dump thousands into a company they couldn't even explain at a dinner table. They don't know how it makes money, what its risks are, or how it stacks up to competitors. They're just trusting some influencer, a thread, or an expert on youtube who doesn't carry their losses. when you buy a stock, you're buying a piece of a real business. That means you own a fraction of its assets, debts, risks, and future profits (or losses). Long-term, the price follows whether the company makes money and stays relevant. Short-term, it moves because of hype, fear, greed, and news.\n\nLook at the meme stock explosions (GME, AMC, WTF). Some people made real money, but the ones who blindly followed rocket emojis and diamond hands memes? Most of them got crushed because they didn't know when to get out. \n\nI get that we live in an age where it's easy to be lazy. Everyone wants the next hot pick. But if you don't know what you own or why you own it, you'll panic when it dips, hold too long when it's dead money, or sell too soon when you should have held. It's just the truth. Don't let the excitement take control of you.\n\nLet be honest with yourself: do you actually understand what you own? Or are you just trusting the crowd?\n\nI'd love to hear how people here actually research before they buy, what's your process? How do you know when it's time to cut a position or double down? And what’s one hype move you regret?",

The higher IV is, the higher premiums on contracts run. The more radically the price of a security swings over a short period of time, the higher IV pumps, driving options prices higher as well.\n\nThe longer the price trades relatively flat, the more IV will drop over time.\n\nIV is just one of many variables (called 'greeks') used to price options contracts.\n\n# WHAT IS HISTORICAL VOLATILITY (HV)? —\n\n(Taken from [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/historicalvolatility.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/historicalvolatility.asp) ) —\n\nDumbed down, I'm not fully sure. Based on what I read, it's a historical metric derived from how the price in the past has moved away from the average price over a selected interval. But the short of it is that it determines how 'risky' the market thinks a stock (or an option I guess) is. The higher the historical volatility over a given period, the more 'risky' they think it is. The lower the HV over a period of time, the 'safer' a security (or option) is.\n\nAnd if anyone wants to fill in some knowledge gaps or correct where these analyses are wrong, please feel free.\n\n# WHAT IS 'MAX PAIN'? —\n\nIn this context, 'max pain' is the price at which the most options (both calls and puts) for a security will expire worthless. For some (or many), it is a long held belief that market manipulators will manipulate the price of a stock toward this number to fuck over people who buy options.\n\n# ONE LAST THOUGHT —\n\nIf used to make any decision. which it absolutely should ***NOT*** be (obligatory #NFA disclaimer), this information should not be considered on its own, but as one point in a ridiculously complex and convoluted ocean of data points that I'm way too stupid to list out here. Mostly, this information is just to keep people abreast of the movement of one key variable options writers use to ***fuck us over*** on a weekly and quarterly basis if we DO choose to play options.\n\nJust thought I should throw that out there.",

This discussion thread is posted Monday at 12:00am Market time.\n\nIf you are looking to learn more about the stock market, custody, and how to protect your investments – you are in the right place!\n\nRetail investors have been on a long march to understand more about the markets and the at times bizarre ways in which they operate. Here are some key takeaways and resources.\n\nWhat is GMEJungle?\n\nGMEJungle is a investing community focused around GameStop, and was founded as an offshoot of other GME communities. GME is a private subreddit, and only approved members can submit posts or leave comments - but anyone can browse the discussions that take place here.\n\nWhat’s this all about?\n\nRetail Investor Rights and Advocacy. The current market structure involves a centralized securities depository for ease of settlement and for access to liquidity. That depository maintains technical ownership rights for the vast majority of all outstanding shares of all publicly issued companies in the United States. Simply: You do not have direct ownership rights of shares you own through a broker.\n\nWhat is DRS?\n\nDRS is a system by which shares are transferred between the DTC (Depository Trust Company) and Transfer Agents. Shares held at DTC include all brokerage holdings, and shares held at Transfer Agents are held directly on the issuer ledger in the name of the investor. Colloquially, DRS also refers to shares which individual investors have decided to own in their own names.\n\nWhat are some pros of DRS?\n\nYou have confidence that your shares are owned by you, and are there when you need them. You can more easily submit shareholder proposals, request and view company documents, and communicate with agents of the company. You know that you will be able to both cast your vote and have your vote counted when participating in votes. You can receive a more favorable tax status on received dividends. You can directly engage with your company and they can directly engage with you.\n\nWhat are some cons of DRS?\n\nYou can’t easily use equity in DRS for margin trading like you can with shares in a brokerage account. Holding in a broker has more ‘anonymity’ as the public has no way to know your holdings or PII, while holding in DRS is comparatively more public. Depending on which transfer agent the company uses, investor access to liquidity may be limited.\n\nWhat a Transfer Agent?\n\nA Transfer Agent is a company which specializes in managing ownership ledgers and providing shareholder services. Every public company must have a Transfer Agent. GameStop uses [Computershare](https://www-us.computershare.com/), an established professional and market leader trusted by thousands of companies around the world.\n\nWhat is the DTC?\n\nDTC is a Self Regulatory organization which controls the nominee [Cede and Co](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cede_and_Company), which is the entity which has the material ownership of most public shares as described above. DTC is one part of the [DTCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_%26_Clearing_Corporation), alongside other bodies including the NSCC. The DTCC is essentially a monopoly on both clearing and settlement in the American markets, one which has been sanctioned by regulators to perform it's duties.\n\nHow do I DRS?\n\nThe answer can vary. For help DRSing GME from over 150 brokers, both American and from around the world, check out these Community-sourced [detailed broker guides](https://www.drsgme.org/register-from-broker). Select your broker from the dropdown to get to the guide, which will walk you through the process including how to get started, how to communicate to your broker, what fees might exist and what cheaper alternatives there are (if any). If your broker isn’t listed here, reach out to the site and we can work together to improve the community resources.\n\nWhere can I learn even more?\n\nComputershare has an extensive [FAQ page](https://www.computershare.com/us/becoming-a-registered-shareholder-in-us-listed-companies) which is excellent and covers a lot of ground regarding how holding your investment directly on the issuer ledger works in practice.\n\nTwo community-built websites that are full of free resources and information are [www.DRSGME.org](https://www.drsgme.org/), which has a variety of information specific to GameStop including the broker guides linked above, and [www.WhyDRS.org](https://www.whydrs.org/). WhyDRS is an [open source platform](https://github.com/WhyDRS) built to provide general assistance and information about custody and finance reform, along with key information on the many thousands of U.S. publicly traded companies.\n\n[The WhyDRS Database](https://database.whydrs.org/) is an extensive, free, open source repository of various contact information for all publicly traded securities.\n\n[The WhyDRS Information Packet](https://www.whydrs.org/the-whydrs-information-packet) covers a wide variety of information about DRS and was put together ahead of when some WhyDRS advocates participated in an interview with Chairman Gensler in 2023. [https://www.whydrs.org/the-whydrs-information-packet](https://www.whydrs.org/the-whydrs-information-packet)\n\nTypes of Holdings: Book-Entry vs Book vs Plan vs Certificate\n\nYou may see these terms when referring to share ownership. In short:\n\nBook-Entry means any share that is electronically tracked in a ledger rather than being held on physical paper.  \nBook and Plan are two labels for shares that are used in Computershare's Investor Center.  \nBook shares (DRS) are fully owned by the investor. Plan shares (DSPP) are owned by Computershare’s nominee, with the investor’s name appearing on the ledger in a subclass. Part of Plan shares are kept with DTC for Operational Efficiency. Exact custody chain details are provided by Computershare and quoted below. Both DRS and DSPP shares are book-entry. Certificates, meanwhile, are still tracked by the TA but have a sanctioned physical certificate associated with that share.\n\n\"Purchases made through the issuer (or its transfer agent) of securities you intend to hold in DRS are usually executed under the guidelines of an issuer’s stock purchase plan, which uses a broker-dealer to execute the orders. Thus, to hold in DRS once the securities are acquired, you would need to instruct the transfer agent to move the securities from the issuer plan to DRS.\" - [SEC Bulletin 7/12/23](https://www.sec.gov/about/reports-publications/investor-publications/holding-your-securities-get-the-facts)\n\n\"Purchases made through the issuer (or its transfer agent) of securities you intend to hold in direct registration are usually executed under the guidelines of the issuer’s stock purchase plan. You’ll need to instruct the transfer agent to move the securities to the DRS.\" - [FINRA Investor Insight 7/12/23](https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/know-the-facts-direct-registered-shares)\n\nIf you are an investor seeking total ownership of your assets, both SEC and FINRA agree that holding in directly on the issuer ledger and in your own name is the only way. Holding shares with the issuer's transfer agent in an investment plan is more direct than holding with a broker in terms of named ownership - with DRS holdings even more so. Shares held with a Plan are not DRS - they are held by the TAs nominee (for Computershare, this is Dingo and Co), and must be transferred out of the plan and into DRS. This is explained by Computershare on their [FAQ page](https://www.computershare.com/us/becoming-a-registered-shareholder-in-us-listed-companies) under ‘chains of custody’. This question was one of several asked by the [WhyDRS.org](http://WhyDRS.org) community in early 2024, and we appreciate Computershare for providing a detailed answer. Their whole FAQ page has a ton of information, and is useful for any investor looking to know more.\n\nQ: “Can you outline the chains of custody and ownership for Pure DRS and DSPP shares enrolled in the DirectStock Plan? Please specify how names are recorded 'On the Ledger' in different holding scenarios. (added 5/16/24)\"\n\nA: \"The first part is a very straightforward answer. There is no ‘chain of custody’ for DRS or Pure DRS. Investors hold the shares in their own name. There is no intermediary. Computershare’s role here is solely as a transfer agent (i.e., the agent of the issuer).\n\nFor the DSPP, we use a Computershare nominee to hold the underlying shares. For the largest portion of the plan holding (80%-90%), these shares are held on the register in the main class. So the chain of custody is “CPU Nominee -> Investor”.\n\nFor the 10%-20% that we hold via our broker at DTC, the custody chain is “Cede -> Broker -> Computershare -> investor”. Notwithstanding this, all holding types are registered and held in the name of the investor in the sub-class.”\n\nIs Buying through DSPP a Problem?\n\nThere is nothing wrong with purchasing through DirectStock if that is what makes sense for you, as it does come with some additional benefits. Many international investors buy GameStop through the plan because DirectStock is much more affordable than buying through a broker and paying them to do a DRS transfer. The fee for DirectStock is $5 and some international brokers cost hundreds of dollars to DRS, so it's smart to use DirectStock in these cases. You can check your broker's DRS transfer rates on their guidepage at DRSGME.org. Other investors buy through DirectStock because they want to be able to schedule recurring buys, or would like to be able to buy in fractional shares and accumulate ownership in smaller portions over time.\n\nIf you choose to buy through the DirectStock plan, and want to ensure total ownership of your assets, manually terminate the plan after each purchase. This will leave your account with pure DRS holdings, but comes with the cost of selling off your fractional share - this is because only whole shares can be held in direct registered ownership. Because the proceeds will be reduced by the selling fee, it's likely you will receive $0 for selling the fractional share, though you will also not be charged as the fee cannot exceed the sale price. Here's the [DRSGME guide on terminating DirectStock](https://www.drsgme.org/terminating-from-directstock).\n\nWhat is GameStop's Investment Plan?\n\nGameStop contracts Computershare as a Transfer Agent to manage it's stock ledger and distribute shareholder materials such as proxy materials for the annual general meeting. Computershare offers several proprietary plan structure to interested companies, including a custom option called CIP (Computershare Investment Plan) and managed DSPs (Direct Stock Purchase) for other companies such as Home Depot in which the issuer can sell stock directly to investors. However, by far the most common plan offering that they have is called DirectStock, which is a Direct Stock Purchase Plan. [The boiler plate DirectStock brochure is located here.](https://cda.computershare.com/Content/7bfc0b25-4836-40a4-918c-9a86d658d798) GameStop uses the DirectStock plan.\n\nLegacy Computershare DD Series (from 2021 to 2022)\n\nThis series was originally written by PinkCatsonAcid, who started this sub a few years ago.

Good luck to all. Go get that cone.\n\nThe Rules are simple: =================================================\n\n\\-To Win: Guess the closest to the closing daily price for GME. (the final settled price, not including After-hours trading) Guess must be in by 10:30am EST (NYT). (One hour after the opening bell)\n\n• ⁠An exact guess AKA the Bullseye Crew you get 2 cones for the season total standings. The count for the Bullseye Crew is just the exact number of Bullseyes this season per player.\n\n\\-No Edits: your guess is your guess, and once it is in, it cannot be changed. Early bird gets the guess. (if you edit your guess, you are disqualified for that day, sorry). If you notice your guess has already been taken, do not edit your guess but comment underneath it. At that point you can make a new guess but it still has to be in by 10:30 EST (One hour after the opening bell)\n\n\\-B2B Sniping Rule: Last guess of the day cannot win on back to back days. All guesses must be in USD amounts.\n\n\\-The seasonal standings are below the closing score and yesterday's winner. The winners circle is the hall of fame of past season winners. This is for the player with the most total wins per season. There are 250 games per season we play every day the market is trading.\n\n============================================\n\n\\*WINNERS CIRCLE\n\nSeason 1 Winner: Lorien6 ( 31 Wins )\n\nSeason 2 Winner: Bloodshot\\_Blinkers ( 34 Wins )\n\nSeason 3 Winner: isthatfair1234 ( 22 wins )\n\nCLOSING PRICE: $23.59\n\nWinning Guesses: $23.55 Musesoutloud\n\nNotes: Muses winning on a very competitive day.

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nLong-time lurker here, follower of the DD, and supporter of the movement from early on. I never imagined I’d be writing this, but today I made the difficult decision to pull all my investments from GME.\n\nI’m moving, and I really need the money. In the past, I would have tightened my belt and found other ways to manage rather than touch my GME shares. But lately, I’ve been overwhelmed by frustration—not just with the stock, but with the state of the business itself.\n\nI have two young boys, and we all love video games and collectible card games. We are GameStop’s target audience. But every time we try to engage with the company, we walk away disappointed.\n\nI bought a $100 GameStop gift card for them at Christmas. We haven’t been able to use it. Our local store—where we used to go once a month to shop and pick up our “free” Pokémon pack with the monthly Pro membership credit—shut down. I tried using the card online, but every time I place an order for something that appears in stock, the checkout fails. After some digging, I learned that the error happens because the item isn’t actually available.\n\nAs a last effort, I took my boys on a long drive to get 50 of our best cards PSA graded at a GameStop. The process took hours due to system crashes. Months later, when the cards were finally ready for pickup, I got a notification—only to learn the store they were sent to had permanently closed. No one told me. I had to investigate myself just to find out that they were rerouted to a store even farther away.\n\nThis investment always felt like more than money to me. It felt like standing up to the shady practices of companies like Citadel, while also supporting a business that once brought my family joy. But that joy is gone. I’m exhausted.\n\nI’m not here to change minds. I still believe in the spirit of this community and wish you all the best. I genuinely hope you win this fight. I’m just stepping out now—for my boys, for my peace of mind.\n\nThank you for everything.",

        "title": "Concept of Risk and Expectation Management",
        "text": "**Why No One Tells the Real Truth About Why 90% of Traders Lose**\n\nYou’ve constantly been told to \"manage your risk\" or \"use a stop-loss.\" This is advice as superficial as telling someone caught in a hurricane to \"try not to get wet.\" The reason 90% of investors lose money is not their failure to use a stop-loss; it's that they enter the game from the very beginning with completely flawed expectations and toxic assumptions.\n\nThe market is not a place designed for you to make money. The market is a giant mechanism designed to transfer liquidity (i.e., the money of small investors like you) to a group of the smartest and most ruthless players. In this chapter, we will lay out the mental and strategic models that will transform you from being the prey into, at the very least, a survivor who can understand the predator's logic. After reading this, your entire perspective on the word \"risk\" will change.\n\n\n\n# Part 1: Expectation Management: Destroying the Toxic Assumptions in Your Mind\n\n\n\nThe root of failure is not flawed strategies, but flawed beliefs. Here are the three deadly assumptions the market uses to trap you, which you have accepted without question.\n\n\n\n# 1. The Obsession with \"Being Right\": Your Ego is Your Greatest Enemy\n\n\n\n* **The Classic Lie:** A good trader is right in their analysis most of the time.\n* **The Bitter Truth:** The market doesn't care about you. It is not concerned with whether you are \"right\" or \"wrong.\" You can think a company is \"undervalued,\" and all your analysis might support that. But if a giant fund decides to sell that stock for the next six months, your money will run out long before you are proven right. **The market rewards those with deep pockets, not those who are right.**George Soros, one of the greatest investors in history, says: *\"It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong.\"*What does this mean? Imagine you make 10 trades. You are wrong on 7 of them and take small losses. But on the 3 trades where you are right, you win so big that you wipe out all 7 losses and end up profitable. Most investors do the exact opposite: they take 9 small profits, but on a single trade, their stubborn need to \"be right\" causes them to erase all those profits and a chunk of their principal.**The Behavioral Shift:** Stop asking, \"Is my analysis correct?\" Start asking this: \"If I'm wrong on this trade, how much will I lose? If I'm right, what is my potential gain?\" If the potential gain is not at least 3 times your potential risk, the trade is not worth taking, no matter how \"right\" it seems. Leave your ego at the door. Profitability is more important than being right.\n\n\n\n# 2. The Market is Not \"Fair\" and It Owes You Nothing\n\n\n\n* **The Classic Lie:** If you work hard and do good research, the market will reward you.\n* **The Bitter Truth:** This is not a meritocracy; it's a food chain. While you spend hours reading balance sheets, someone else is getting insider information. While you draw technical analysis patterns, a High-Frequency Trading (HFT) algorithm is hunting your order in microseconds. While you wait for the \"Non-Farm Payroll\" data, economists at major banks have already forecasted the number with their proprietary models days ago.**Example:** Consider the GameStop (GME) event in 2021. Retail investors banded together to inflict billions of dollars in losses on large hedge funds via a \"short squeeze.\" It seemed like a fair victory, didn't it? But what happened next? Brokerage firms like Robinhood disabled the \"Buy\" button to protect the big players. Millions of small investors were prevented from buying, and the stock's ascent was halted. This is the clearest evidence of who the rules are written for. Don't be surprised if the market cheats you; it's the nature of the game.**The Behavioral Shift:** Stop expecting \"fairness\" from the market. Escape the victim mentality. Instead of whining, \"Why did this happen?\" ask, \"I knew this was a possibility, so what is my defense plan?\" View the market not as a partner, but as a wild animal that could attack you at any moment. The goal is not to be paranoid, but to always be prepared.\n\n\n\n# 3. The \"Get Rich Quick\" Dream: The Most Dangerous Bait They Offer\n\n\n\n* **The Classic Lie:** You can turn a small amount of money into a massive fortune with high leverage.\n* **The Bitter Truth:** The \"get rich quick\" dream is the most effective bait that brokers and market makers use to lure you into the game. High leverage is a weapon designed not to grow your capital, but to wipe it out in the fastest way possible.**Simple Math:** Imagine you open a position with 10x leverage. If the asset goes up by 10%, you double your money (a 100% profit). Fantastic, right? But if the same asset drops by just 10%, **you lose your entire capital.** How likely is a 10% move in the market? Especially in crypto and forex, it can happen within hours. This isn't even a gamble; in a casino, you at least have the option to walk away from the table. Here, the system is designed to make you more prone to losing.This dream triggers your brain's reward center (dopamine). A small win gives you the courage to take an even bigger risk on the next trade. This is known as the \"Gambler's Fallacy.\" And when you lose, you engage in \"Revenge Trading,\" making even more irrational trades out of a desperate need to \"win back your losses.\"**The Behavioral Shift:** Change your goal. The objective is not to \"get rich quick,\" but to \"**stay in the game long enough to get rich slowly.**\" Your capital is your chips in the game. If you run out of chips, the game is over for you. By risking only a tiny fraction on each trade, you earn the right to play hundreds of hands. Remember, a new opportunity is born in the market every day, but those opportunities are meaningless if your capital is gone.\n\n\n\n# Part 2: Real Risk Management: Survival Strategies in the Whales' Hunting Ground\n\n\n\nOnce you've corrected your expectations, it's time for realistic defense strategies. These go far beyond what you've read in classic textbooks.\n\n\n\n# 1. Stop-Loss is a Mindset, Not an Order: The Danger of \"Stop Hunts\" and \"Getting Triggered\"\n\n\n\n* **The Classic Advice:** Always use a stop-loss.\n* **The Deeper Truth:** If you know where to place your stop-loss, so do the whales. There is a phenomenon in the market called \"stop-hunting.\" Big players can see where stop-loss orders from retail traders are clustered (usually at obvious support/resistance levels or psychological numbers like $50.00 or $100.00). They will intentionally push the price to that level, trigger thousands of stop orders, collect the liquidity, and then let the price reverse back in its true direction. Have you ever said, \"I got stopped out, and then the price immediately reversed\"? It's not a coincidence.**Advanced Defense Strategy:**\n   1. **Don't Place Stops at Obvious Levels:** Never place your stop order exactly on a support level or a round number. Place it slightly below or above, factoring in the market's \"noise.\" Using volatility indicators like ATR (Average True Range) is far smarter than using static levels.\n   2. **See a Stop-Loss as a Fee, Not a Failure:** When a stop order is triggered, don't see it as a failure. See it as **a fee you pay for information.** That stop order gave you this piece of information: \"My thesis for this trade, at least for now, has not been validated by the market.\" This mindset removes your ego from the equation and allows you to move on to the next trade without emotional baggage.\n   3. **Plan Your Exit Before You Enter:** Before buying a stock or coin, clearly define and write down the answers to: \"Where will I sell to take profit?\" and \"Where will I accept the loss and get out?\" Once the price starts moving, your emotions take over, and you can't think rationally. The plan must be made when you are calm.\n\n\n\n# 2. Position Sizing: This is the True Holy Grail\n\n\n\n* **The Classic Advice:** Never risk more than 1-2% of your capital on a single trade.\n* **Understanding Why:** Everyone hears this rule, but almost no one understands its soul. The point isn't about losing 1%. The point is that **recovering from a catastrophic loss is mathematically next to impossible.The Brutal Math Table:**If you lose 50% on a single trade with a large position, you are forced to double your remaining money just to get back to where you started, which pushes you to take even bigger risks. This is why position sizing is more important than anything else. It's more important than finding a good strategy or doing the right analysis. Because even the best analyst can be wrong, but a trader who survives with proper position sizing will always be around for the next opportunity.**The Behavioral Shift:** Before entering any trade, calculate how much you will lose in absolute terms if your stop is hit. If this amount exceeds 2% of your total capital, reduce your position size (the number of lots/coins you buy). This will slow you down, but it will also keep you in the game.\n   * If your capital drops by 10%, you need an **11%** gain to break even. (Easy)\n   * If your capital drops by 25%, you need a **33%** gain to break even. (Hard)\n   * If your capital drops by 50%, you need a **100%** gain to break even. (Very Hard)\n   * If your capital drops by 75%, you need a **400%** gain to break even. (Nearly Impossible)\n\n\n\n# 3. Hunting for Asymmetric Opportunities: The Ultimate Goal of Risk Management\n\n\n\n* **The Classic Advice:** Enter trades with a good risk/reward ratio.\n* **The Deeper Strategy:** Risk management is not just about defense. It is also what gives you the courage to seize the rare opportunities that offer **asymmetric** returns. An asymmetric opportunity is a situation where the potential loss is limited and small, while the potential profit is enormous (e.g., 1-to-10, 1-to-20).Where are these opportunities found?Risk management allows you to make small, controlled bets when you see these kinds of opportunities. Because you know that if you're wrong, you'll lose very little, but if you're right, you could make a life-changing gain.\n   * **Crypto:** Taking a position at the very beginning of a new narrative that no one is talking about yet. Your risk is that your investment goes to zero (100% loss). But if you enter with proper position sizing (e.g., 1% of capital), it's a tolerable loss. If that narrative takes off, your gain could be 20x, 50x. This is the **venture capital (VC) mindset.** 9 out of 10 bets may fail, but that one success finances them all.\n   * **Stocks:** A company trading near its bankruptcy valuation but holding hidden value (patents, real estate, etc.). The downside risk is limited, but the upside potential on positive news is massive.\n   * **Forex:** Taking a position in the direction the market has settled after a major central bank decision, once the storm has passed. The biggest risk (volatility) is over, but the potential for the trend to continue is high.\n\n**Conclusion: The Game Played Against Yourself**\n\nThe market is the playground of giants and algorithms. You cannot beat them directly. But you can manage your own psychology, your ego, and your expectations within the game they've constructed. Risk management is less a technical skill and more the art of winning this mental war.\n\n**You can't beat the market, but you can beat yourself. And most of the time, that's all it takes to stay in the game.**",

        "text": "Hello everyone i don't know wh is going to believe this and i really don't care. I want to point out facts and you can believe it for yourself. Since 2014 my big brother worked security for Drais  here in Las Vegas,NV. 2015 I thought it would be a good idea to make Abel a medallion and put my contact information on the back of it and give it to him. I asked my brother to get my mom and I in. He asked his boss and his boss agreed because my brother is a hard worker. I got the idea to give the medallion to Abel after my brother called my mom on the phone when we live in Idaho New Years 2015 that Abel punched a cop. He heard it on his radio and seen the scene unfolding in the elevator he didn't want to do a incident report so he turned and walked away lol 😂 After the concert I seen LJ and asked if he could give it to Abel for me and he agreed to. Let's say Abel got in contact with me and been speaking to privately for the past decade getting ideas off of me and copying me without credit. I have proof of it well. I started worked at Allegiant Stadium since 1st gme and quit last year. I'm not happy I gave him that medallion, he's a fake and a fraud and I'm tired of him copying me and seeing others replicate it when the ideas aren't coming from him. He got sued many times from other people for copyright. I can see why. The proof are in the photos I'm posting. When I was a teenager I used to go to Bone Thugs N Harmony Concerts told Abel about it as well. I beaded Bizzy a medallion when I was 17. I thought i would do one for Abel too and he's been copying me without credit. The flannel is my grandmas from the 90s she passed away in 2010. It hung up in my closet til inwas skinny enough to fit into it wear it becusse i misssed my grandma just for it to be copied and see other wear that sh*t its uncool and unfair when not being named without credit and its something from someone who means alot to you for strangers to wear it and have other make profit on it and I been seeing my stuff end up in Bella Hadid perfume Campaign. I have fibromyalgia since age 16 in pain everyday an keeps me away most night due to insomnia and pain he knows that as well. I ended up in more than a few homeless situations due to bad things happening while Abel knew of my existence I ended up crashing my vehicle a short while after my mom passed away from Kidney Failure in 2020. My mom knew what I did. She was there beside me when I gave the medallion to LJ he gave me and her a hug and swore he would give it to him and I'm Tired of seeing people copy me which they get from him which he's getting from me for the past decade in secret. I have invitations from the puma show in Aug 2017 when he had his shoe launch I happened to get a spot up front and he seen me and I got photos of him stating right back at me and never seen him again. One of things i told him about me growing up that my mom and my grandma used to take me to the cemetery and pull off old flowers take me to the store and make new flower arrangements to place on our passed loved ones. Then I started to see it in his music. I seen a lot of my life end up in the idol and especially hurry up tomorrow he used my identiy for mainstream and not doing anything about it because of the people around. Fake asf. I deleted his music off my Playlist based on the treatment. The public is fooled. those twins, bella are in the industry because of their rich parents I'm tired of seeing plastic surgery take and use my ideas from Abel which he is okay with idk why but I feel it's for him newfound image otherwise he be not known. They own you when you sign yourself to a label that the image they gave him everyone been fooled for a decade. Everyone thought diddy sex workers was crazy until everything came out.. ... what is the dark will come to light. \n",

        "title": "Chapter 11 as a Strategic Reset: Why BBBY’s story may not be over for Shareholders",
        "text": "**“Crisis is opportunity riding the dangerous wind.” – Chinese Proverb**\n\n  \nNowhere does this feel more relevant than in the saga of **Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)** a company once worth more than Amazon, now seemingly reduced to ashes. But what if *Chapter 11* wasn’t the end, but a reset? What if this restructuring, however brutal, is the only way out of the disaster manufactured by years of mismanagement?\n\n**The Real Problem: Reckless Governance & the Buyback Trap**\n\nFrom 2004 to 2022, BBBY spent **$11.8 billion** on share buybacks a staggering amount that was not backed by earnings or growth but funded largely by debt. \n\nAs Harvard Business Review and modern corporate finance theory teach us, **buybacks are only value-generating when a company is undervalued, has strong free cash flow, and no better investment opportunities**. BBBY ticked none of these boxes.\n\n**By 2022, the company faced:**\n\n(i) $5.2 billion in debt;\n\n(ii) Poor inventory management;\n\n(iii) A crumbling private-label strategy;\n\n(iv) Missed opportunities in e-commerce and digital transformation.\n\nIn short, management hollowed out the business to artificially boost stock prices a textbook example of **short-termism** and failed governance.\n\n**Chapter 11: A Legal Tool, is NOT a Death Sentence.**\n\nContrary to what many believe, **Chapter 11 does not automatically mean liquidation or total destruction of shareholder value**. In fact, U.S. bankruptcy law was designed to *restructure*, *protect core assets*, and allow businesses to emerge stronger. Yes, common stock is often cancelled, but:\n\n**\"The cancellation of old shares can be a necessary mechanism for debt-for-equity swaps, new capital injections, or reverse mergers all of which can eventually reintroduce equity participation for original stakeholders.\"**\n\nEspecially in cases where:\n\n(A) Significant **Net Operating Losses (NOLs)** exist (as with BBBY);\n\n(B) Valuable **brand IP and customer data** remain (Buy Buy Baby, loyalty programs, etc.);\n\n(C) There is **ongoing interest from potential acquirers or financial sponsors.**\n\n**The Potential Play: Reset Now, Reissue Later.**\n\nIf a NewCo potentially backed by strategic players like GME, RC Ventures, or others emerges from the ashes, the **shell of BBBY (even without current public shares)** could be leveraged as a vehicle for:\n\n**(A) Reverse merger;** \n\n**(B) SPAC-style reentry into public markets;** \n\n**(C) Unlocking NOLs for tax advantages;** \n\n**(D) Restoring brand equity with better management and tech.**\n\nIn such scenarios, **legacy shareholders could be offered warrants, class B equity, or convertible instruments**. While not guaranteed, there is legal precedent for post-confirmation shareholder recovery *if fraud, insider misconduct, or undervaluation of assets is proven*.\n\n  \n**Legal Implications: When Cancellation Isn’t the End.**\n\nSeveral avenues remain open:\n\n**(i) Challenges under Rule 10b-5 (SEC)** if material misstatements occurred before Chapter 11**;** \n\n**(ii) Fiduciary duty breach claims** if directors knowingly destroyed value**;** \n\n**(iii) RICO or fraud claims** if collusion between management, lenders, and short sellers is demonstrated**;** \n\n**(iv) Shareholder-led derivative actions** upon emergence.\n\nAnd perhaps most crucially, **a Chapter 11 plan can be modified post-confirmation if fraud or material error is discovered**.\n\n**Final Thoughts: Hope Is Not a Strategy, But Strategy Is Not Dead**\n\nYes, the plan confirmed in September 2023 cancelled the common shares.  \nYes, the Liquidating Trust is now in place.  \nBut **a cancelled share is not always a worthless share** especially when *the entity that rises from the ashes inherits everything but the shareholders*, unless pressure mounts for equitable treatment.\n\nIf what happened to BBBY was **a crime disguised as a restructuring**, then legal action and investor organization are not only justified — they’re essential.\n\n**So no, this isn’t over.**  \nNot for the shareholders.  \nNot for the courts.  \nNot for history\n\nAnd Not for FBI, DOJ , and us.\n\n**#BBBY #Chapter11 #ShareholderRights #Restructuring #CorporateGovernance #FinancialJustice #ReverseMerger #NOL #FraudDetection #GME #WallStreet#FBI#DOJ#SEC**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/phcnn4vql2bf1.png?width=1011&format=png&auto=webp&s=57b0738784941d782eff10d6554b814e36bfe85c\n\n  \n",

        "text": "So as you can probably guess ive been watching a lot of Log Horizon and SAO so I want to use the idea of an MMO world as the setting for my next solo game.  I am using BREAK!! Rpg as my game of choice.  I am wanting to get community ideas for house rules or ways to give it the feel of an MMO. \n\nHere are a few of my current ideas.\n\n1.) Resurrection is very rare and death is final. - I want that SAO vibe of danger and lethality along with player killers being risky.\n\n2.) Other PCs and/or Player Killers outside of safe areas are almost always a part of the random encounter lists\n\n3.) West Marches style with the pool of pcs coming from a guild roster. I plan on having a roster from leads to officers to regular members\n\n4.) Downtime checks for guild related events such as new pcs joining, people leaving etc..(Still debating how to do this).\n\n5.) Mythic GME for randomization and any oracle needs.\n\n6.) World Events\n\n7.) Seasonal Events\n\nAny other ideas or suggestions are quite welcome. I look forward to hearing from other points of view and if anyone else has tried this before.",

I would really appreciate any advice on how to make a good thumbnail or get and understanding on the process of making them\n\nHeres two thumbnails I’m trying to decide on. I like the simplicity of one first but feel there’s too much dead space. And the second feels like there’s nothing of value. Any advice helps thank you",
