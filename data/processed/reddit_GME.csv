2025-07-05 11:00:00,"House Rule Ideas to turn game setting into an MMO World. So as you can probably guess ive been watching a lot of Log Horizon and SAO so I want to use the idea of an MMO world as the setting for my next solo game. I am using BREAK!! Rpg as my game of choice. I am wanting to get community ideas for house rules or ways to give it the feel of an MMO. Here are a few of my current ideas. 1. Resurrection is very rare and death is final. I want that SAO vibe of danger and lethality along with player killers being risky. 2. Other PCs andor Player Killers outside of safe areas are almost always a part of the random encounter lists 3. West Marches style with the pool of pcs coming from a guild roster. I plan on having a roster from leads to officers to regular members 4. Downtime checks for guild related events such as new pcs joining, people leaving etc..Still debating how to do this. 5. Mythic GME for randomization and any oracle needs. 6. World Events 7. Seasonal Events Any other ideas or suggestions are quite welcome.

2025-07-05 15:00:00,"Chapter 11 as a Strategic Reset Why BBBYs story may not be over for Shareholders. Crisis is opportunity riding the dangerous wind. Chinese Proverb Nowhere does this feel more relevant than in the saga of Bed Bath Beyond BBBY a company once worth more than Amazon, now seemingly reduced to ashes. But what if Chapter 11 wasnt the end, but a reset? What if this restructuring, however brutal, is the only way out of the disaster manufactured by years of mismanagement? The Real Problem Reckless Governance the Buyback Trap From 2004 to 2022, BBBY spent .8 billion on share buybacks a staggering amount that was not backed by earnings or growth but funded largely by debt. As Harvard Business Review and modern corporate finance theory teach us, buybacks are only valuegenerating when a company is undervalued, has strong free cash flow, and no better investment opportunities. BBBY ticked none of these boxes. By 2022, the company faced i .2 billion in debt ii Poor inventory management iii A crumbling privatelabel strategy iv Missed opportunities in ecommerce and digital transformation. In short, management hollowed out the business to artificially boost stock prices a textbook example of shorttermism and failed governance. Chapter 11 A Legal Tool, is NOT a Death Sentence. Contrary to what many believe, Chapter 11 does not automatically mean liquidation or total destruction of shareholder value. In fact, U.S. bankruptcy law was designed to restructure, protect core assets, and allow businesses to emerge stronger. Yes, common stock is often cancelled, but The cancellation of old shares can be a necessary mechanism for debtforequity swaps, new capital injections, or reverse mergers all of which can eventually reintroduce equity participation for original stakeholders. Especially in cases where A Significant Net Operating Losses NOLs exist as with BBBY B Valuable brand IP and customer data remain Buy Buy Baby, loyalty programs, etc. C There is ongoing interest from potential acquirers or financial sponsors. The Potential Play Reset Now, Reissue Later. If a NewCo potentially backed by strategic players like GME, RC Ventures, or others emerges from the ashes, the shell of BBBY even without current public shares could be leveraged as a vehicle for A Reverse merger B SPACstyle reentry into public markets C Unlocking NOLs for tax advantages D Restoring brand equity with better management and tech. In such scenarios, legacy shareholders could be offered warrants, class B equity, or convertible instruments. While not guaranteed, there is legal precedent for postconfirmation shareholder recovery if fraud, insider misconduct, or undervaluation of assets is proven. Legal Implications When Cancellation Isnt the End. Several avenues remain open i Challenges under Rule 10b5 SEC if material misstatements occurred before Chapter 11 ii Fiduciary duty breach claims if directors knowingly destroyed value iii RICO or fraud claims if collusion between management, lenders, and short sellers is demonstrated iv Shareholderled derivative actions upon emergence. And perhaps most crucially, a Chapter 11 plan can be modified postconfirmation if fraud or material error is discovered. Final Thoughts Hope Is Not a Strategy, But Strategy Is Not Dead Yes, the plan confirmed in September 2023 cancelled the common shares. Yes, the Liquidating Trust is now in place. But a cancelled share is not always a worthless share especially when the entity that rises from the ashes inherits everything but the shareholders, unless pressure mounts for equitable treatment. If what happened to BBBY was a crime disguised as a restructuring, then legal action and investor organization are not only justified theyre essential. So no, this isnt over. Not for the shareholders. Not for the courts. Not for history And Not for FBI, DOJ , and us.

2025-07-05 17:00:00,"Hurry Up Sin City. Hello everyone i don't know wh is going to believe this and i really don't care. I want to point out facts and you can believe it for yourself. Since 2014 my big brother worked security for Drais here in Las Vegas,NV. 2015 I thought it would be a good idea to make Abel a medallion and put my contact information on the back of it and give it to him. I asked my brother to get my mom and I in. He asked his boss and his boss agreed because my brother is a hard worker. I got the idea to give the medallion to Abel after my brother called my mom on the phone when we live in Idaho New Years 2015 that Abel punched a cop. He heard it on his radio and seen the scene unfolding in the elevator he didn't want to do a incident report so he turned and walked away lol After the concert I seen LJ and asked if he could give it to Abel for me and he agreed to. Let's say Abel got in contact with me and been speaking to privately for the past decade getting ideas off of me and copying me without credit. I have proof of it well. I started worked at Allegiant Stadium since 1st gme and quit last year. I'm not happy I gave him that medallion, he's a fake and a fraud and I'm tired of him copying me and seeing others replicate it when the ideas aren't coming from him. He got sued many times from other people for copyright. I can see why. The proof are in the photos I'm posting. When I was a teenager I used to go to Bone Thugs N Harmony Concerts told Abel about it as well. I beaded Bizzy a medallion when I was 17. I thought i would do one for Abel too and he's been copying me without credit. The flannel is my grandmas from the 90s she passed away in 2010. It hung up in my closet til inwas skinny enough to fit into it wear it becusse i misssed my grandma just for it to be copied and see other wear that sht its uncool and unfair when not being named without credit and its something from someone who means alot to you for strangers to wear it and have other make profit on it and I been seeing my stuff end up in Bella Hadid perfume Campaign. I have fibromyalgia since age 16 in pain everyday an keeps me away most night due to insomnia and pain he knows that as well. I ended up in more than a few homeless situations due to bad things happening while Abel knew of my existence I ended up crashing my vehicle a short while after my mom passed away from Kidney Failure in 2020. My mom knew what I did. She was there beside me when I gave the medallion to LJ he gave me and her a hug and swore he would give it to him and I'm Tired of seeing people copy me which they get from him which he's getting from me for the past decade in secret. I have invitations from the puma show in Aug 2017 when he had his shoe launch I happened to get a spot up front and he seen me and I got photos of him stating right back at me and never seen him again. One of things i told him about me growing up that my mom and my grandma used to take me to the cemetery and pull off old flowers take me to the store and make new flower arrangements to place on our passed loved ones. Then I started to see it in his music. I seen a lot of my life end up in the idol and especially hurry up tomorrow he used my identiy for mainstream and not doing anything about it because of the people around. Fake asf. I deleted his music off my Playlist based on the treatment. The public is fooled. those twins, bella are in the industry because of their rich parents I'm tired of seeing plastic surgery take and use my ideas from Abel which he is okay with idk why but I feel it's for him newfound image otherwise he be not known. They own you when you sign yourself to a label that the image they gave him everyone been fooled for a decade. Everyone thought diddy sex workers was crazy until everything came out.. ... what is the dark will come to light.",-0.9217

2025-07-05 19:00:00,"Concept of Risk and Expectation Management. Why No One Tells the Real Truth About Why 90 of Traders Lose Youve constantly been told to manage your risk or use a stoploss. This is advice as superficial as telling someone caught in a hurricane to try not to get wet. The reason 90 of investors lose money is not their failure to use a stoploss it's that they enter the game from the very beginning with completely flawed expectations and toxic assumptions. The market is not a place designed for you to make money. The market is a giant mechanism designed to transfer liquidity i.e., the money of small investors like you to a group of the smartest and most ruthless players. In this chapter, we will lay out the mental and strategic models that will transform you from being the prey into, at the very least, a survivor who can understand the predator's logic. After reading this, your entire perspective on the word risk will change. Part 1 Expectation Management Destroying the Toxic Assumptions in Your Mind The root of failure is not flawed strategies, but flawed beliefs. Here are the three deadly assumptions the market uses to trap you, which you have accepted without question. 1. The Obsession with Being Right Your Ego is Your Greatest Enemy The Classic Lie A good trader is right in their analysis most of the time. The Bitter Truth The market doesn't care about you. It is not concerned with whether you are right or wrong. You can think a company is undervalued, and all your analysis might support that. But if a giant fund decides to sell that stock for the next six months, your money will run out long before you are proven right. The market rewards those with deep pockets, not those who are right.George Soros, one of the greatest investors in history, says It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong.What does this mean? Imagine you make 10 trades. You are wrong on 7 of them and take small losses. But on the 3 trades where you are right, you win so big that you wipe out all 7 losses and end up profitable. Most investors do the exact opposite they take 9 small profits, but on a single trade, their stubborn need to be right causes them to erase all those profits and a chunk of their principal.The Behavioral Shift Stop asking, Is my analysis correct? Start asking this If I'm wrong on this trade, how much will I lose? If I'm right, what is my potential gain? If the potential gain is not at least 3 times your potential risk, the trade is not worth taking, no matter how right it seems. Leave your ego at the door. Profitability is more important than being right. 2. The Market is Not Fair and It Owes You Nothing The Classic Lie If you work hard and do good research, the market will reward you. The Bitter Truth This is not a meritocracy it's a food chain. While you spend hours reading balance sheets, someone else is getting insider information. While you draw technical analysis patterns, a HighFrequency Trading HFT algorithm is hunting your order in microseconds. While you wait for the NonFarm Payroll data, economists at major banks have already forecasted the number with their proprietary models days ago.Example Consider the GameStop GME event in 2021. Retail investors banded together to inflict billions of dollars in losses on large hedge funds via a short squeeze. It seemed like a fair victory, didn't it? But what happened next? Brokerage firms like Robinhood disabled the Buy button to protect the big players. Millions of small investors were prevented from buying, and the stock's ascent was halted. This is the clearest evidence of who the rules are written for. Don't be surprised if the market cheats you it's the nature of the game.The Behavioral Shift Stop expecting fairness from the market. Escape the victim mentality. Instead of whining, Why did this happen? ask, I knew this was a possibility, so what is my defense plan? View the market not as a partner, but as a wild animal that could attack you at any moment. The goal is not to be paranoid, but to always be prepared. 3. The Get Rich Quick Dream The Most Dangerous Bait They Offer The Classic Lie You can turn a small amount of money into a massive fortune with high leverage. The Bitter Truth The get rich quick dream is the most effective bait that brokers and market makers use to lure you into the game. High leverage is a weapon designed not to grow your capital, but to wipe it out in the fastest way possible.Simple Math Imagine you open a position with 10x leverage. If the asset goes up by 10, you double your money a 100 profit. Fantastic, right? But if the same asset drops by just 10, you lose your entire capital. How likely is a 10 move in the market? Especially in crypto and forex, it can happen within hours. This isn't even a gamble in a casino, you at least have the option to walk away from the table. Here, the system is designed to make you more prone to losing.This dream triggers your brain's reward center dopamine. A small win gives you the courage to take an even bigger risk on the next trade. This is known as the Gambler's Fallacy. And when you lose, you engage in Revenge Trading, making even more irrational trades out of a desperate need to win back your losses.The Behavioral Shift Change your goal. The objective is not to get rich quick, but to stay in the game long enough to get rich slowly. Your capital is your chips in the game. If you run out of chips, the game is over for you. By risking only a tiny fraction on each trade, you earn the right to play hundreds of hands. Remember, a new opportunity is born in the market every day, but those opportunities are meaningless if your capital is gone. Part 2 Real Risk Management Survival Strategies in the Whales' Hunting Ground Once you've corrected your expectations, it's time for realistic defense strategies. These go far beyond what you've read in classic textbooks. 1. StopLoss is a Mindset, Not an Order The Danger of Stop Hunts and Getting Triggered The Classic Advice Always use a stoploss. The Deeper Truth If you know where to place your stoploss, so do the whales. There is a phenomenon in the market called stophunting. Big players can see where stoploss orders from retail traders are clustered usually at obvious supportresistance levels or psychological numbers like .00 or .00. They will intentionally push the price to that level, trigger thousands of stop orders, collect the liquidity, and then let the price reverse back in its true direction. Have you ever said, I got stopped out, and then the price immediately reversed? It's not a coincidence.Advanced Defense Strategy 1. Don't Place Stops at Obvious Levels Never place your stop order exactly on a support level or a round number. Place it slightly below or above, factoring in the market's noise. Using volatility indicators like ATR Average True Range is far smarter than using static levels. 2. See a StopLoss as a Fee, Not a Failure When a stop order is triggered, don't see it as a failure. See it as a fee you pay for information. That stop order gave you this piece of information My thesis for this trade, at least for now, has not been validated by the market. This mindset removes your ego from the equation and allows you to move on to the next trade without emotional baggage. 3. Plan Your Exit Before You Enter Before buying a stock or coin, clearly define and write down the answers to Where will I sell to take profit? and Where will I accept the loss and get out? Once the price starts moving, your emotions take over, and you can't think rationally. The plan must be made when you are calm. 2. Position Sizing This is the True Holy Grail The Classic Advice Never risk more than 12 of your capital on a single trade. Understanding Why Everyone hears this rule, but almost no one understands its soul. The point isn't about losing 1. The point is that recovering from a catastrophic loss is mathematically next to impossible.The Brutal Math TableIf you lose 50 on a single trade with a large position, you are forced to double your remaining money just to get back to where you started, which pushes you to take even bigger risks. This is why position sizing is more important than anything else. It's more important than finding a good strategy or doing the right analysis. Because even the best analyst can be wrong, but a trader who survives with proper position sizing will always be around for the next opportunity.The Behavioral Shift Before entering any trade, calculate how much you will lose in absolute terms if your stop is hit. If this amount exceeds 2 of your total capital, reduce your position size the number of lotscoins you buy. This will slow you down, but it will also keep you in the game. If your capital drops by 10, you need an 11 gain to break even. Easy If your capital drops by 25, you need a 33 gain to break even. Hard If your capital drops by 50, you need a 100 gain to break even. Very Hard If your capital drops by 75, you need a 400 gain to break even. Nearly Impossible 3. Hunting for Asymmetric Opportunities The Ultimate Goal of Risk Management The Classic Advice Enter trades with a good riskreward ratio. The Deeper Strategy Risk management is not just about defense. It is also what gives you the courage to seize the rare opportunities that offer asymmetric returns. An asymmetric opportunity is a situation where the potential loss is limited and small, while the potential profit is enormous e.g., 1to10, 1to20.Where are these opportunities found?Risk management allows you to make small, controlled bets when you see these kinds of opportunities. Because you know that if you're wrong, you'll lose very little, but if you're right, you could make a lifechanging gain. Crypto Taking a position at the very beginning of a new narrative that no one is talking about yet. Your risk is that your investment goes to zero 100 loss. But if you enter with proper position sizing e.g., 1 of capital, it's a tolerable loss. If that narrative takes off, your gain could be 20x, 50x. This is the venture capital VC mindset. 9 out of 10 bets may fail, but that one success finances them all. Stocks A company trading near its bankruptcy valuation but holding hidden value patents, real estate, etc.. The downside risk is limited, but the upside potential on positive news is massive. Forex Taking a position in the direction the market has settled after a major central bank decision, once the storm has passed. The biggest risk volatility is over, but the potential for the trend to continue is high. Conclusion The Game Played Against Yourself The market is the playground of giants and algorithms. You cannot beat them directly. But you can manage your own psychology, your ego, and your expectations within the game they've constructed. Risk management is less a technical skill and more the art of winning this mental war. You can't beat the market, but you can beat yourself. And most of the time, that's all it takes to stay in the game.",0.9975

I never imagined Id be writing this, but today I made the difficult decision to pull all my investments from GME. Im moving, and I really need the money. In the past, I would have tightened my belt and found other ways to manage rather than touch my GME shares. But lately, Ive been overwhelmed by frustrationnot just with the stock, but with the state of the business itself. I have two young boys, and we all love video games and collectible card games. We are GameStops target audience. But every time we try to engage with the company, we walk away disappointed. I bought a GameStop gift card for them at Christmas. We havent been able to use it. Our local storewhere we used to go once a month to shop and pick up our free Pokmon pack with the monthly Pro membership creditshut down. I tried using the card online, but every time I place an order for something that appears in stock, the checkout fails. After some digging, I learned that the error happens because the item isnt actually available. As a last effort, I took my boys on a long drive to get 50 of our best cards PSA graded at a GameStop. The process took hours due to system crashes. Months later, when the cards were finally ready for pickup, I got a notificationonly to learn the store they were sent to had permanently closed. No one told me. I had to investigate myself just to find out that they were rerouted to a store even farther away. This investment always felt like more than money to me. It felt like standing up to the shady practices of companies like Citadel, while also supporting a business that once brought my family joy. But that joy is gone. Im exhausted. Im not here to change minds. I still believe in the spirit of this community and wish you all the best. I genuinely hope you win this fight. Im just stepping out nowfor my boys, for my peace of mind. Thank you for everything.",0.9965

2025-07-07 04:00:00,"Weekly Discussion Thread. This is the Weekly discussion thread Happy Monday, everyone! This discussion thread is posted Monday at 1200am Market time. If you are looking to learn more about the stock market, custody, and how to protect your investments you are in the right place! Retail investors have been on a long march to understand more about the markets and the at times bizarre ways in which they operate. Here are some key takeaways and resources. What is GMEJungle? GMEJungle is a investing community focused around GameStop, and was founded as an offshoot of other GME communities. GME is a private subreddit, and only approved members can submit posts or leave comments but anyone can browse the discussions that take place here. Whats this all about? Retail Investor Rights and Advocacy. The current market structure involves a centralized securities depository for ease of settlement and for access to liquidity. That depository maintains technical ownership rights for the vast majority of all outstanding shares of all publicly issued companies in the United States. Simply You do not have direct ownership rights of shares you own through a broker. What is DRS? DRS is a system by which shares are transferred between the DTC Depository Trust Company and Transfer Agents. Shares held at DTC include all brokerage holdings, and shares held at Transfer Agents are held directly on the issuer ledger in the name of the investor. Colloquially, DRS also refers to shares which individual investors have decided to own in their own names. What are some pros of DRS? You have confidence that your shares are owned by you, and are there when you need them. You can more easily submit shareholder proposals, request and view company documents, and communicate with agents of the company. You know that you will be able to both cast your vote and have your vote counted when participating in votes. You can receive a more favorable tax status on received dividends. You can directly engage with your company and they can directly engage with you. What are some cons of DRS? You cant easily use equity in DRS for margin trading like you can with shares in a brokerage account. Holding in a broker has more anonymity as the public has no way to know your holdings or PII, while holding in DRS is comparatively more public. Depending on which transfer agent the company uses, investor access to liquidity may be limited. What a Transfer Agent? A Transfer Agent is a company which specializes in managing ownership ledgers and providing shareholder services. Every public company must have a Transfer Agent. GameStop uses Computershare an established professional and market leader trusted by thousands of companies around the world. What is the DTC? DTC is a Self Regulatory organization which controls the nominee Cede and Co which is the entity which has the material ownership of most public shares as described above. DTC is one part of the DTCC alongside other bodies including the NSCC. The DTCC is essentially a monopoly on both clearing and settlement in the American markets, one which has been sanctioned by regulators to perform it's duties. How do I DRS? The answer can vary. For help DRSing GME from over 150 brokers, both American and from around the world, check out these Communitysourced detailed broker guides Select your broker from the dropdown to get to the guide, which will walk you through the process including how to get started, how to communicate to your broker, what fees might exist and what cheaper alternatives there are if any. If your broker isnt listed here, reach out to the site and we can work together to improve the community resources. Where can I learn even more? Computershare has an extensive FAQ page which is excellent and covers a lot of ground regarding how holding your investment directly on the issuer ledger works in practice. Two communitybuilt websites that are full of free resources and information are www.DRSGME.org which has a variety of information specific to GameStop including the broker guides linked above, and www.WhyDRS.org WhyDRS is an open source platform built to provide general assistance and information about custody and finance reform, along with key information on the many thousands of U.S. publicly traded companies. The WhyDRS Database is an extensive, free, open source repository of various contact information for all publicly traded securities. The WhyDRS Information Packet covers a wide variety of information about DRS and was put together ahead of when some WhyDRS advocates participated in an interview with Chairman Gensler in 2023. Types of Holdings BookEntry vs Book vs Plan vs Certificate You may see these terms when referring to share ownership. In short BookEntry means any share that is electronically tracked in a ledger rather than being held on physical paper. Book and Plan are two labels for shares that are used in Computershare's Investor Center. Book shares DRS are fully owned by the investor. Plan shares DSPP are owned by Computershares nominee, with the investors name appearing on the ledger in a subclass. Part of Plan shares are kept with DTC for Operational Efficiency. Exact custody chain details are provided by Computershare and quoted below. Both DRS and DSPP shares are bookentry. Certificates, meanwhile, are still tracked by the TA but have a sanctioned physical certificate associated with that share. Purchases made through the issuer or its transfer agent of securities you intend to hold in DRS are usually executed under the guidelines of an issuers stock purchase plan, which uses a brokerdealer to execute the orders. Thus, to hold in DRS once the securities are acquired, you would need to instruct the transfer agent to move the securities from the issuer plan to DRS. SEC Bulletin 71223 Purchases made through the issuer or its transfer agent of securities you intend to hold in direct registration are usually executed under the guidelines of the issuers stock purchase plan. Youll need to instruct the transfer agent to move the securities to the DRS. FINRA Investor Insight 71223 If you are an investor seeking total ownership of your assets, both SEC and FINRA agree that holding in directly on the issuer ledger and in your own name is the only way. Holding shares with the issuer's transfer agent in an investment plan is more direct than holding with a broker in terms of named ownership with DRS holdings even more so. Shares held with a Plan are not DRS they are held by the TAs nominee for Computershare, this is Dingo and Co, and must be transferred out of the plan and into DRS. This is explained by Computershare on their FAQ page under chains of custody. This question was one of several asked by the WhyDRS.org community in early 2024, and we appreciate Computershare for providing a detailed answer. Their whole FAQ page has a ton of information, and is useful for any investor looking to know more. Q Can you outline the chains of custody and ownership for Pure DRS and DSPP shares enrolled in the DirectStock Plan? Please specify how names are recorded 'On the Ledger' in different holding scenarios. added 51624 A The first part is a very straightforward answer. There is no chain of custody for DRS or Pure DRS. Investors hold the shares in their own name. There is no intermediary. Computershares role here is solely as a transfer agent i.e., the agent of the issuer. For the DSPP, we use a Computershare nominee to hold the underlying shares. For the largest portion of the plan holding 8090, these shares are held on the register in the main class. So the chain of custody is CPU Nominee Investor. For the 1020 that we hold via our broker at DTC, the custody chain is Cede Broker Computershare investor. Notwithstanding this, all holding types are registered and held in the name of the investor in the subclass. Is Buying through DSPP a Problem? There is nothing wrong with purchasing through DirectStock if that is what makes sense for you, as it does come with some additional benefits. Many international investors buy GameStop through the plan because DirectStock is much more affordable than buying through a broker and paying them to do a DRS transfer. The fee for DirectStock is and some international brokers cost hundreds of dollars to DRS, so it's smart to use DirectStock in these cases. You can check your broker's DRS transfer rates on their guidepage at DRSGME.org. Other investors buy through DirectStock because they want to be able to schedule recurring buys, or would like to be able to buy in fractional shares and accumulate ownership in smaller portions over time. If you choose to buy through the DirectStock plan, and want to ensure total ownership of your assets, manually terminate the plan after each purchase. This will leave your account with pure DRS holdings, but comes with the cost of selling off your fractional share this is because only whole shares can be held in direct registered ownership. Because the proceeds will be reduced by the selling fee, it's likely you will receive for selling the fractional share, though you will also not be charged as the fee cannot exceed the sale price. Here's the DRSGME guide on terminating DirectStock What is GameStop's Investment Plan? GameStop contracts Computershare as a Transfer Agent to manage it's stock ledger and distribute shareholder materials such as proxy materials for the annual general meeting. Computershare offers several proprietary plan structure to interested companies, including a custom option called CIP Computershare Investment Plan and managed DSPs Direct Stock Purchase for other companies such as Home Depot in which the issuer can sell stock directly to investors. However, by far the most common plan offering that they have is called DirectStock, which is a Direct Stock Purchase Plan. The boiler plate DirectStock brochure is located here. GameStop uses the DirectStock plan. Legacy Computershare DD Series from 2021 to 2022 This series was originally written by PinkCatsonAcid, who started this sub a few years ago.

2025-07-07 04:00:00,"IV Max Pain, Volume and OI Data, every day until MOASS or society collapses 07032025. Weeks Closing Over Max Pain Consecutive 2 Current Longest Streak of Weeks Closing Under Max Pain Consecutive 4 Previous Longest Streak of Weeks Closing Under Max Pain Consecutive 4 07022025 First Post Posted in May, 2024 IV30 Data Free, Account Required Max Pain Data Free, No Account Needed! Fidelity IV Data Free, Account Required And finally, at someone's suggestion WHAT IS IMPLIED VOLATILITY IV? Taken from Dumbed down, IV is a forwardlooking metric measuring how likely the market thinks the price is to change between now and when an options contract expires. The higher IV is, the higher premiums on contracts run. The more radically the price of a security swings over a short period of time, the higher IV pumps, driving options prices higher as well. The longer the price trades relatively flat, the more IV will drop over time. IV is just one of many variables called 'greeks' used to price options contracts. WHAT IS HISTORICAL VOLATILITY HV? Taken from Dumbed down, I'm not fully sure. Based on what I read, it's a historical metric derived from how the price in the past has moved away from the average price over a selected interval. But the short of it is that it determines how 'risky' the market thinks a stock or an option I guess is. The higher the historical volatility over a given period, the more 'risky' they think it is. The lower the HV over a period of time, the 'safer' a security or option is. And if anyone wants to fill in some knowledge gaps or correct where these analyses are wrong, please feel free. WHAT IS 'MAX PAIN'? In this context, 'max pain' is the price at which the most options both calls and puts for a security will expire worthless. For some or many, it is a long held belief that market manipulators will manipulate the price of a stock toward this number to fuck over people who buy options. ONE LAST THOUGHT If used to make any decision. which it absolutely should NOT be obligatory NFA disclaimer, this information should not be considered on its own, but as one point in a ridiculously complex and convoluted ocean of data points that I'm way too stupid to list out here. Mostly, this information is just to keep people abreast of the movement of one key variable options writers use to fuck us over on a weekly and quarterly basis if we DO choose to play options. Just thought I should throw that out there.",-0.9857

Shortterm, it moves because of hype, fear, greed, and news. Look at the meme stock explosions GME, AMC, WTF.

Macroeconomics doesn't look good for GameStop in the next 23 years. Given the current riskreward picture, I am not bullish above Not saying we won't see higher prices, as volatility is the tail that wags the dog influences price a ton so the volatilityoptions market can support GME higher play the risks in front of you but macroeconomics alone is bad for GameStop.... Rising Treasury yields weakens future cash flows, discount rate and thus equity valuations. The bottom line is compression on earnings that favors insurance like businesses Warren Buffet recently stepped down, as if to setup his successor to buy the dip on the insurance market. Microsoft laid off how much of its workforce recently? From my perspective, GameStop is growing increasingly dependent on playing volatility, abstractly. From social to financial.. and the similarities between 1690's projectors behaviors and RC's.. has me concerned. It contradicts a lot of the original messaging from RC himself with that interview with Joe iirc back in 2021, suggesting a internal cultural pivot, maybe around early last year summer, towards more social vol playing over fundamental investing in the business. Let me put it this way, I love GameStop in part because I grew up with the company, even worked at my local GameStop during college, but from a pure macroeconimic lens, the riskreward on GME above isn't for me. Not at all. I've called out below with interest, last year and most recently .50, but if it wasn't for the volatility risks in play, I wouldn't have even considered .50! I buy under valued assets that align with current risks then manage them. It's boring but it works. So please be careful going forward.

2025-07-07 17:00:00,"Shortys get LOW LOW LOW LOW. I was doing a bit of thinking about my own investment strategy, seeing lots and lots of red and got me to realize something. Here is where we stand On the bullish side IF you treat the new bonds as straight cash for now and not the debt they really are which is reasonable imo given the 7year timeline, .63 billion 447.3 million shares .30 per share. Thats the floor. The low since the bond offering was 21.72 and the high was 24.43, with the vast majority of trading occuring between 22 and 24. we are clearly in a stable zone. Even if you take away the bonds, the floor is still . IV is at record lows, literally in the 04 range right now The new deltaneutral bond traders AND options sellers both profit off of higher IV. They are not making much money now. Also, default in this situation is short vega. The only winner is Market Makers who can maintain delta neutral low gamma books without hedging too much on new positions Correct me if im wrong but this is THE time to DCA into leaps over the next few weeks? All major momentum oscillators are trending oversold or neutral RSI is between 3040, MACD is negative but bottoming the worst is nearly over Richard Newton seems to think there MAY be one more dip idk either way but if he does that may be genuine YOLO time On the bearish side Volume continues to fall MA's continue to trend down There is no bullish crossover yet on RIS or MACD Low IV may actually mean nothing will happen soon Options volume is shockingly low for the IV Macro market is near ATH and may drag GME down with it if it corrects Bearish side is all true, but it wont be forever. This seems to be a... wild setup? In April 2024, GME had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of .083 billion divided by a total sharecount of 310 million, equalling a cash floor of .50 per share while the price was around 2.85x. I am not sure what the IV was back then, but it couldnt have been high as the price had fallen from over the last month. That 4year low in both is what prompted Keith to make his move and build a gamma ramp on top of basket swapftd? action. Based on this information, I cannot see how this current enviornment isnt building a PERFECT setup extremely low IV and price. Price can only drop by 3 more in the next 7 years, and IV has NEVER been below 45 since 2020. IF WE HIT A SIMULTANIOUS low in both, and that happens to coincide right before Swap dates or FTD regions... it may be go time. If not then, then probably fucking never jfc In heindsight, yeah no shit it was obv never dates. Perhaps the Semour meme wasnt about waiting for RC, it was about waiting for price action to get LOW before an inevitable runup. Compression can only go so far. A few times over the last year early Jan, late May where price goes up, IF gamma ramps had been concentrated, it could have plausibly mooned as many TA guys were calling for but they didnt. Price and IV were not low enough beforehand to create a setup. This time may be different. No dates, look for red.",-0.9786

2025-07-07 18:00:00,"Dreams of Ilveria 18 LGBTQ Friendly Diversity Friendly Narrative Heavy Looking to add additional players to our group! Help us defeat a pantheon of terrible gods!. Hello! I'm looking for one or two more players to add to a campaign I'm running with some friends. We play DMless, using Mythic GME and RPG. This campaign is pretty dark, but we all work to handle serious topics respectfully. I can actually go into detail in DMs, but this is not the campaign for you if you aren't okay with confronting serious issues with nuance. This is also not the campaign for you if you're looking for edgy topics without any significant meaning behind them. I'll start with the system, Mythic. We play through Discord, so have now simplified stat checks to asking odds questions. It's a very basic system, you'll really just need to learn how to interpret the Fate Chart which is easier than it seems. We're very narrative focused, so don't expect a lot of combat in this. All combat is also resolved through yesno questions, using the Fate Chart. We don't have a set time that we meet each week. I do my best to find out when everyone is available and schedule sessions accordingly. No voice chat is involved. Because this is DMless, everyone is expected to contribute to the story, worldbuilding, and playing NPCs. In particular, we could use more players who are comfortable playing villains and other important NPCs though you will also have your own PC. We have a very diverse cast of characters, inspired by various cultures and time periods. The base setting is medieval fantasy, but nothing is off limits so long as the culture would make sense to exist around that very broad time period. I'm looking for people who have decent writing skills, so I will require a very brief about a paragraph or two writing sample. I will provide the character and a brief background for them. All you have to do is give me an inner monologue or something else, if you want from their perspective. The character has a pretty intense background, lots to work with, so it shouldn't be too difficult. To verify that you've actually read this, please type fish somewhere in your comment. If you have questions, feel free to throw them at me. I am happy to answer! Edit We are in the US, forgot to include that in the title!",0.9926
