2025-07-03 18:34:21,"And all I got from the SEC is ...""we acknowledge your email..."". I finally had time last weekend to write back to the SEC (see previous [SEC says I am not allowed to know who caused the CAT errors... : r/Superstonk]( Note: I am not a MULN investor; only GME, and DRS'd at that. MULN has appeared on the Nasdaq RegSHO list every day since last summer when I started noticing it. **TL;DR:** The SEC is lazy as and does absolutely nothing. ""Hello again SEC, The latest CAT error statistics were released on Thursday night, 26th June ( [ ). I note that on 17th June there were 7 BILLION CAT errors recorded. All the measures you outlined in your email are simply not working to prevent errors from happening in the first place. Anonymity should not be granted to those who cause such errors; section 613 doesn’t help investors with the necessary transparency. In this modern day and age, it is unconscionable to have financial market systems where continuous errors are allowable and not managed. Once again, I stress that the SEC is failing in its duties to stop CAT errors happening. Even in the previous report from May 2025, 3.6B errors were reported on 14th April; 1.1B errors on 15th April; 2.6B errors on 16th April; and 1.6B errors on 1st May. This is not acceptable. And yes, while the RegSHO reporting is a measure of “cumulative number of all fails outstanding until that day, plus new fails that occur that day, less fails that settle that day,” it does not explain why, stocks like MULN (Mullen Automotive) have appeared on it every single day for months and months. Why is this consistently allowed? Are the fails-to-deliver settled and then failed again on the same day by the same participants? MULN has been on the NASDAQ RegSho for months. The SEC has allowed this situation where fails-to-deliver occur day after day. Who keeps failing to deliver? And why can’t we as investors know who consistently fails to deliver this and other stocks? The headline on the SEC website says “We make markets work better.” That is incongruent with the evidence. Please revert with an action plan on: \* How the SEC will prevent CAT errors from occurring \* How the SEC will make the names of those responsible for CAT errors visible to investors \* How the SEC will investigate and stop continuous fails-to-deliver so that investors receive what they have purchased on the date expected I look forward to your response. Regards, TransatlanticMadame."" and they responded today - with the laziest response ever that someone could say ""well I responded before a holiday weekend.""

Moass tomorrow, but tomorrow comes and nothing. It will continue to do nothing cause the bigwigs who short this stock are the ones in control and nothing can be done about it. So if you want your money just to sit for years and you make nothing then leave it in GME. For me it’s not worth it anymore. Just like DFV said 5 years and nothing then it’s time to move on. Idc if GME has no debt or it’s bought bitcoin the stock price is what I care about and it’s taking way to long and nothing to show. It’s the slowest moving stock. You make better returns on CCL or sound or Tesla. Wake up people and quit listening to these gamers who are delusional.",0.9158

2025-07-03 21:44:07,"Reminder to new Crypto Investors.. Just a reminder to everyone thinking about entering crypto and focusing on smaller market cap coins to diversify. Make sure to include an investigation of tokenonmics on the coin you want to invest in before investing. You WANT to know who's under you when buying on top. If there's not a reasonable reason as to why there is a small amount of top holders, then steer clear. For example, the asshole community on eth who use my favorite ticker and come sliding into the on solana chat to spread fud and just be dick heads, straight up - on Ethereum. Or as I like to call ""daddy's money clan"" top holders compromise it. Just look at the picture attached from bubble maps. The project is COOKED. MASSIVELY bundled barely any spread, not enough holders, small % of holdings through out, claims affiliation to gamestop and they somehow get away with it when its a PURE LIE AND BUILT FOR A LIQUIDITY SUCKING EVENT. 🚨 The picture on the left is gme eth (cooked) The picture on the right is gme sol (hawt) The big percentages of holders on solana are exchanges + community. Go look for yourself how many exchanges gme on solana is listed on currently VS this dumpster fire of a contract on eth. DO NOT BE FOOLED. THE REAL ORGANIC COMMUNITY IS ON SOLANA.",0.8809

I used to scrape GameStop's PSA web store multiple times a day to see trends in inventories. This worked well for many months until they changed something that blocked my bot... I never fixed it so haven't looked at trends recently. What I did see was a downward trend in stock from people buying with small spikes when they would add new stock to the website. I watch the total graded cards go from \~5000 slowly down to \~3000 over a few months. It's currently sitting at 7946 total cards. Since I haven't been watching trends I can't tell you if this has been one huge inventory addition, or if they have been incrementally but this is by far the highest I have seen. The price estimates might not seem large in comparison to the rest of GameStop's operations, but keep in mind this is roughly in pieces of cardboard, this is a huge inventory for this kind of collectable. They are constantly buying new cards and selling them for a profit, they are taking a cut on all PSA submissions, and also getting the additional sales when people come in to use this service.

I my self am not much of an IPhone gamer but thought since it's so accessible and comes so highly recommended that I might give it a shot. Before I do, I just had one really basic question I wanted to ask. I was just curious and wanted to know how much of the gme would be locked behind a paywall? I know that the Applevis site says it's free with in app purchase. Money is really tight for me right now so I just wanted to know how much of the game will I be able to play before I run up against locked content, or will I be able to watch ads to get around that somehow? Thanks in advance for any information you can give. I'm really interested in exploring this title assuming not too much of it will be restricted to those of us who are just barely getting by.",0.9723

To try and explain what I’m doing here lets make up an analogy of a coin flipping game. To play the game you must buy in with . Every time you get heads you win. The first win is , and every time after that you double your money. You get to flip the coin a maximum of 7 times. The player can choose to stop to collect the winnings. If you get one tails you lose. So total winnings can be , for a small price of . But the chance to get 7 heads in a row is less than 1%. Even just to break even with 2 heads in a row is 25%. 3 heads for winnings: 12.5% chance. 4 heads for a win: 6.25% chance. 5 heads for win: 3.125% chance. 6 heads for win: 1.5625% chance. I like to be the seller of this game which is why I like to sell weekly lottos. Although I don’t make much, I have a high chance to make the money each time. (Note: First time I played this game with my gf she got 5 heads in a row and I had to pay her .) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Happy 4th of July. See you next week.",0.9969

2025-07-04 16:29:16,"Has GameStop Forged a Cost Path Toward Sustainable Profitability? (Spoiler: Yes, yes they have. Well done apes and RC 👏we are unstoppable 💪). GameStop Corp. GME delivered a notable improvement in its fiscal first-quarter 2025 results, driven largely by disciplined cost management and improved operational efficiency. The company slashed adjusted SG&A expenses by 24.8% year over year, bringing the metric down to .3 million. As a percentage of net sales, adjusted SG&A improved 320 basis points to 30.8%. This underscores management’s efforts to streamline operations and enhance efficiency without undermining core business functions. The company’s cost discipline supported a 3.4% rise in gross profit, which increased to .8 million from .5 million. Gross margin expanded significantly by 680 basis points to 34.5%, highlighting improved pricing and cost control. Despite declining revenues, GameStop managed to protect its product-level profitability. Operationally, GameStop saw strong gains. Adjusted EBITDA turned positive at .6 million, reversing a loss of .6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income also improved significantly, reaching .5 million in contrast to a loss of million in the last year. GameStop’s bottom-line performance further highlighted the benefits of its cost restructuring. The company shifted from a net loss of .3 million to a net income of .8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Adjusted net income improved to .1 million from a loss of .7 million, with adjusted earnings per share rising to 17 cents from an adjusted loss of 12 cents in the prior-year quarter. However, net sales declined 17% year over year, due to weakness in hardware and software. Growth in the collectibles segment offered some offset, but long-term success will depend on stabilizing core revenues and scaling newer growth areas.",0.9812

2025-07-04 18:07:43,"T+35, REX 068, and Synthetic FTD Rollovers Explained. There’s a lot of confusion around FTDs, T+35 deadlines, and how market makers keep kicking the can. Here’s a full breakdown of how it actually works and how it applies to GME right now. What is T+35? When a trade fails to deliver (FTD), market makers have 35 trading days to resolve it. This is tracked by the NSCC, and T+35 is the final day they are supposed to deliver shares or close out the fail. Example: If millions of FTDs were created on June 12, then July 17 is the official T+35 deadline. What is REX Code 068? It’s an obscure regulatory exemption that allows clearing members to delay FTD resolution beyond T+35. Based on historical patterns, REX 068 appears to grant up to 13 extra trading days to delay. So a June 12 FTD → July 17 (T+35) → Aug 14–19 (final extension window). Why hasn’t GME exploded yet? Because they don’t cover FTDs all at once. They: 1. Run the price slightly (e.g., to ) 2. Short it back down to – 3. Use that volume to close a portion of FTDs 4. Repeat the cycle, stretching the delivery window This turns the FTD cycle into a negotiable game of supply and sentiment. --- Synthetic FTD Coverage: The Hidden Delay Trick Here’s what most people miss: > They can sell large amounts of deep OTM calls to synthetically cover FTDs. This satisfies some NSCC requirements without delivering real shares It gives the appearance of delivery — or the ability to deliver Once those calls expire, the new T+35 window starts from the expiration date This tactic allows market makers to: Delay real share delivery Control short-term price action Avoid breaking regulatory rules Why This Matters Right Now GME had 1.5M+ FTDs around June 12 T+35 = July 17, 2025 REX 068 extension = ~Aug 14–19 window Earnings land shortly after that > If high retail volume aligns with this window, and shorts get pinned, forced covering can trigger large moves. TL;DR T+35 = 35 trading days from original fail REX 068 = up to 13-day extension OTM calls can be sold to synthetically ""cover"" FTDs T+35 resets from the day those synthetic calls expire July 17–Aug 19 = High alert window 🔥So if you look at the call chain and price is at .50 and there's 10-20k calls near thats not retail thats the synthetic covering, and the new T+35 timer starts at exp of those calls. Stay sharp. Watch volume, options chains, and pressure points. This game isn’t over.",-0.8868
